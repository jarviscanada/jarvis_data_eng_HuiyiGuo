# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate of McGill University with a Bachelor's degree in Statistics and Computer Science. Through my previous internship experiences and the education I gained from university, I gained solid coding skills with Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, and C as well as problem solving and collaboration skills that I can carry to future roles. During my studies, backend and full-stack development captured my heart as I can turn my creative ideas into applications that solve real-world problems. I enjoy learning new techniques and continuously improving them. I'm now sharpening my abilities with tools and technologies that are commonly used in the business and implementing my skills at Jarvis Consulting Group.

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: This project is about developing a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that provides metrics about system activities. Bash scripts are used to collect data from the host system every minute using cron and saved to PostgresSQL server that runs inside a docker container.

  #    - "Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam."
      - "JDBC App: This project implemented a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) application using the JDBC API to connect to a database and run queries to obtain the data. The user can use the application to perform predefined actions on the database, such as CRUD operations. Java, JDBC, Maven, Postgres, and Docker were all used when building this application."
      - "Grep App: This application is a Java-based application that mimics the Linux command line grep function. This application searches files recursively in a given directory and outputs the matched text pattern using regex to a file. The project was completed using Maven Standard Directory Layout following industry standards. Additionally, Lambda API and Stream API are used for managing larger inputs. The grep application was then dockerized and uploaded to DockerHub as a Docker Image."
